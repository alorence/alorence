Hey, I'm Antoine Lorence, Python developer, FOSS enthusiast, software architecture specialist and GNU/Linux fan. I live in France and
have 2 children.

I started to work as professional developer after my Master's degrees, in 2010. I first worked on C++ and Java softwares, then I discovered
Python. I started to use it for some tasks as a readable replacement for Bash/sh scripts, then I discovered all the incredible things that can be
achieved with it. In the next years, I started to build websites with Django and various applications. I work now as a Freelancer and more recently,
I extended my knowledge in various fields like frontend development or DevOps.

## Notable projects

In 2016, I had to configure an XML-RPC endpoint in a Django project I worked on. At this time [RPC4Django](https://github.com/rpc4django/rpc4django)
was the most used library. Unfortunately, it didn't work with latest Django version, was not updated for a long time and the PRs
opened to fix issues remained unanswered. I decided to start my own implementation, with a very similar API, but with a support for
recent Python & Django versions.


The project has recently reached its first 1.0.0 stable release and is now downloaded almost [10.000 times / month](https://pepy.tech/project/django-modern-rpc).

### pysvg-py

*Unofficial Python 3 portage of well-known PySVG library.*

Years ago, while porting a legacy project from python 2 to python 3, I discovered that [PySVG](https://pypi.org/project/pysvg/) library was not compatible
with Python 3, and no new release were published since 2012. After quickly checking the source code, I saw that adapting the code shouldn't be a big deal.
I forked the project, ran [2to3](https://docs.python.org/3/library/2to3.html) and verified that the result worked as expected in my project.

I decided to [publish it on pypi](https://pypi.org/project/pysvg-py3/) with a disclamer explaining this is an unofficial port and I was not the original
author. That package seemed to be useful for others, since it is now downloaded about [5.000 times per month](https://pepy.tech/project/pysvg-py3).
